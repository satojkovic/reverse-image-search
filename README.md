# DeepViSe

Yet another implementation of DeViSE model (inspired by [Building a Reverse Image Search AI using PyTorch](https://vijayabhaskar96.medium.com/fun-project-devise-on-pytorch-83eb09694d41)).

# Description

DeViSE (A Deep Visual-Semantic Embedding Model) is proposed by A.Frome et al. at NIPS2013.

This repository provides training and test environment in PyTorch.

# Usecase

## Keyword search

Search "car".
